Probabilistic programs are a structured way to describe computations or models with access to some source of randomness. They appear naturally in various safety-, security-, and privacy-critical applications, including randomized algorithms, security protocols, and autonomous systems working in uncertain environments, e.g., due to imprecise sensors. 

The behavior of probabilistic programs is often counterintuitive — a consequence of the well-known fact that humans have difficulties reasoning about stochastic processes. In combination with their importance in emerging safety-critical domains, the counterintuitive nature of probabilistic programs means that ensuring their correctness must be based on verification and analysis techniques that are rigorous, tool-supported, and, ideally, largely automated. However, such tools have not kept up with the increasing usage and popularity of probabilistic programs.

In part, the lack of tool support can be explained by the fact that research on probabilistic programs is spread over multiple fields. In addition to the classical understanding of probabilistic programs as randomized algorithms, probabilistic programs have received rapidly increasing attention as a modeling formalism for complex probability distributions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.

This workshop will provide a forum for research on the automated verification of probabilistic systems that are in some way described by a programming language, with a particular focus on both symbolic methods and compositional approaches.

# Call for Presentations

VeriProP 2022, co-located with CAV and the federated logic conference, aims to bring together researchers interested in the tool-supported verification of probabilistic programs, models, and systems. This includes probabilistic model checking, program verification in the presence of a source of randomness, or formal guarantees for statistical machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence systems. 
We are excited to have 4 invited speakers covering a range of perspectives:
Erika Abraham, RWTH Aachen University, Germany
Kuldeep Meel, National University of Singapore
Sylvie Putot, LIX Ecole Polytechnique, France 
Andrzej Wasowski, ITU, Denmark
We solicit contributed short presentations. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Symbolic approaches to the verification of Markov models
Exact inference techniques
Abstract interpretation for probabilistic programs
Domain-specific probabilistic programming languages
Verification of inference algorithms
Automation of deductive approaches to verifying probabilistic programs-
Probabilistic program reasoning in safety, security, or privacy
Synthesis of probabilistic programs
We call for extended abstracts (1-2 pages in pdf format) describing either ongoing research or an overview of past research in the workshop’s scope. We welcome abstracts covering work that has been previously published or is currently under review. There will be no formal proceedings.
